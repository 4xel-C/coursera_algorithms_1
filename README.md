# Princeton's Algortihms, part I (Coursera)
This repository contains all source codes required for the project validation for the algorithms class provided by [Princeton university via Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1). 
For this set of lessons, Princeton University provides the students with the **algs4.jar** package to give some life quality improvement on the most used functionnalities. (*user's input, print, randomization...*).
This package is used for the student to focus on the core aspect of this training: **Algorithms implementation and efficiency**.

# Index of projects
- **[Hello](/hello):** This repository contains very simple programs for the sole purpose of testing coursera grading and submissions process.
- **[Percolation](/percolation)**: This repository contains a program that can estimate the **percolation threshold** via *Monte Carlo* simulation using **Union Find datastructure** to kepp track of the conencted sites.
- - **[Queues](/queues)**: Implementation of a Queue, a Randomized Queue, and a Deque with Java. 

# Note on project's structures
All the source code have been build fin the *default package* accoring to the recommendation of the training program. This have been made to facilitate the grading/submission system.
