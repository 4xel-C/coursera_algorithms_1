# Princeton's Algortihms, part I (Coursera)
This repository contains all source codes required for the project validation for the algorithms class provided by [Princeton university via Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1). 
For this set of lessons, Princeton University provides the students with the **algs4.jar** package to give some life quality improvement on the most used functionnalities. (*user's input, print, randomization...*).
This package is used for the student to focus on the core aspect of this training: **Algorithms implementation and efficiency**.
